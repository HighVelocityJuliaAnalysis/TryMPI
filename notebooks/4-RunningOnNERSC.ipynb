    "\n",
    "Let's try to run `displayRank.jl` at NERSC. You should log into `cori.nersc.gov` now and we'll set things up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One time setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the following steps once to set things up\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clone this git repository\n",
    "In your NERSC home area, do \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/HighVelocityJuliaAnalysis/TryMPI.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That will download this repository to your home area.\n",

    "### Prepare Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to prepare Julia to install the packages we'll use. Do the following...\n",

    "build --verbose\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `build --verbose` command will produce a bit of output. You should seee a line with `Info: using systme MPI`. If you don't see that line, then something is wrong.\n",

    "\n",
    "On your laptop, we used `mpiexecjl` to run Julia scripts with MPI. On Cori, we instead use a command called `srun`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are logged into a Cori *login* node. The login nodes are used to write code and prepare software. MPI programs will not run on the login node. You can see for yourself with,\n",

    "To run Julia with MPI interactively, we need to request an *interactive worker node*. The worker node is a Cori node used for running jobs and can run MPI. You can request a node with,\n",

    "salloc --qos=interactive -C haswell --time=10 --nodes=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You are requesting one *Haswell* node for 10 minutes of interactive use. Haswell is the type of machine you want. Cori has two choices, *Haswell* and *KNL*. The Haswell nodes are faster and have more memory, so we'll use that. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can take while for the `salloc` command to run. You should eventually someething like,\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your command prompt has changed. It doesn't say `cori` anymore. It will now say the name of the worker node (`nid00284` in this case). \n",
    "\n",
    "You may now try,\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "srun -n 4 julia --project displayRank.jl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may request up to 64 ranks with the `-n` option. Try `calc_e_gather.jl` and `calc_e_reduce.jl` too. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done with the interactive worker node, you may type `exit` to go back to the Cori worker node. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, when your 10 minutes are up, you will be logged out of the worker node automatially. You'll see a message like,\n",
