    "With MPI, we can have terms calculated simultaneously with parallel processes. The simplest way to do this is to have each rank calculate a term and then add them all up. So the number of terms in the sum will be the same as the number of ranks. An interesting challenge with this code is how to do the sum? Each rank will only know the value of its term. We will need to use MPI communication in order to have each rank communicate its term to a *Root rank*. The root rank is a special rank that will collect information from the other ranks and process it - in this case, the root rank will sum up the terms. MPI doesn't care which rank is the root rank, but it is customary to choose Rank 0 as the root. "
