The ranks are numbered from 0, so `-n 4` will give Ranks with numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. MPI allows communication between the ranks, and the way to do that is to use a *communicator*. MPI has a built in communicator called `MPI.COMM_WORLD`, that allows all of the ranks to talk to each other (the \"world\"). It is possible to create communicators that talk to a subset of ranks, but we won't do that yet. Because typing `MPI.COMM_WORLD` is kind of a pain, it is common to use a shorter variable name, as is done here with `comm`. \n",

Therefore, `myRank` will be different for each copy. `nRanks` will always be the same for each Rank, since the total number of ranks is a constant. Note that we use the `comm` communicator in each function call. \n",

The program won't proceed until every rank reaches this point. This is called *synchronization*. In general, synchronization makes your program slower and should be used only when necessary. We'll see examples of when we need to use it. In this case, since it is the last line of the program, we don't actually need it. There is an implicit synchronization when the program ends. "
