# TryMPI

Trying and learning MPI with Julia ([MPI.jl](https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/)).

This repository has notebooks and code for trying out MPI with Julia. There are some [notebooks](https://github.com/HighVelocityJuliaAnalysis/TryMPI/tree/main/notebooks) to try.

## Using this repository effectively

The best way to use these examples and notebooks is to clone this repository and use VSCode.

### Cloning the repository

VSCode makes it easy to clone a respository. Start up VSCode and open the File Explorer in the side bar (it may be open already). You should see a green box with "Clone Repository". Click on that and for the URL, enter `https://github.com/HighVelocityJuliaAnalysis/TryMPI`. You will then need to chose a location for the repository. Then choose `Open` to open the repository. You should see the respository directory structure in the File Explorer. Click on the notebooks folder and choose `0-Getting Started`.

### Returning to the Repository

If you quit VSCode and want to continue working on the notebooks, just restart VSCode. In the opening window, you should see a `Recents` section. Click on `TryMPI` to return to the repository.

### Updating the Repository

From time to time, new examples and code will be added to the repository. You can update your local version of the repository by, in VSCode, doing Cmd-Shift-P to bring up the command pallette and choosing `Git: Pull` (type in the first few letters to get it to appear). Note that there are other `Pull` VSCode commands. Be sure to choose this one.
