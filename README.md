# TryMPI

Trying and learning MPI with Julia ([MPI.jl](https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/)).

This repository has notebooks and code for trying out MPI with Julia. There are some [notebooks](https://github.com/HighVelocityJuliaAnalysis/TryMPI/tree/main/notebooks) to try.

## Using this repository effectively

The best way to use these examples and notebooks is to clone this repository and use VSCode.

### Cloning the repository

VSCode makes it easy to clone a respository. Start up VSCode and open the File Explorer in the side bar (it may be open already). You should see a green box with "Clone Repository". Click on that and for the URL, enter `https://github.com/HighVelocityJuliaAnalysis/TryMPI`. You will then need to chose a location for the repository. Then choose `Open` to open the repository. You should see the respository directory structure in the File Explorer. Click on the notebooks folder and choose `0-Getting Started`.

### Returning to the Repository

If you quit VSCode and want to continue working on the notebooks, just restart VSCode. In the opening window, you should see a `Recents` section. Click on `TryMPI` to return to the repository.

### Updating the Repository

From time to time, new examples and code will be added to the repository.
